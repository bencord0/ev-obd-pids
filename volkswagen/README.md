# VW MEB UDS PIDs

The MEB PIDs are based on the excellent work done by [spot2000 on Github](https://github.com/spot2000/Volkswagen-MEB-EV-CAN-parameters)

The e-Golf and e-Up PIDs are based on data from [GoingElectric](https://www.goingelectric.de/wiki/Liste-der-OBD2-Codes/), and sharkcow's [Github Repository](https://github.com/sharkcow/VW-e-UP-OBD-CAN-logs)
