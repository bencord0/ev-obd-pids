# EV-OBD-PIDs
This repository contains a consolidation of the various OBD PID lists that are available openly on the internet for Electric Vehicles, formatted such that they can be imported by A Better Routeplanner's OBD integration. 

Many thanks to the hard work by those who have reverse engineered the PIDs for various manufacturers and contributed to this repository.
